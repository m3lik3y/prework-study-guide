## Description

The modules in the Prework Study Guide introduces the type of work we'll experience within the coding bootcamp. Understanding the acceptance criteria in each module helps in applying good practice in preparation for real world experiences. Building the Prework Study Guide was a struggle to understand at first, but a well worth experience of ups and downs to accomplish the acceptance criteria. Creating code will always come with intuitive decision making scenarios such as debugging, code settings in VS code, correct navigation knowledge in the Terminal, etc. From beginners to advanced veteran developers, there will always be a new challenge we'll each face not knowing a correct solution. Thus we come together from all experiences and solve together!
